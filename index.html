    <!-- When using webpack-dev-server, the webpack output is served from the root directory, which means that we can use 'main.js' in our script path. Note that webpack-dev-server stores the webpack bundle in memeory, not in a 'dist' folder. If we were to use 'dist/main.js' our script path below, then we'd be referring to the version of 'main.js' in the 'dist' folder and that would only work, if we had used our 'npm run build' command before running 'npm run start:dev'. -->
